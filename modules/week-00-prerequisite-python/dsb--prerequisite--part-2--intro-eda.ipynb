    "### 2.2 Data Exploration and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pandas, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is how we “get to know” the dataset before modeling or reporting.\n",
    "You can think of it as the first audit pass: verify columns, scan values, and surface data issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Analogy for Accounting:\n",
    "Just as an auditor reviews a trial balance to spot anomalies (missing entries, wrong types, out-of-range values), EDA checks each column’s content, completeness, and basic statistics to ensure downstream calculations are trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Steps We’ll Perform\n",
    "1) Categorical scan  \n",
    "   - Identify text/object columns (e.g., customer, region, currency).  \n",
    "   - Count unique values and preview a few examples to spot typos or unexpected categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Missing-value audit  \n",
    "   - Tally nulls per column to gauge data completeness.  \n",
    "   - Decide what is “critical” (e.g., posting_date, total_open_amount) and must not be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Business status snapshot (if column exists)  \n",
    "   - Summarize operational flags (e.g., isOpen) to see open vs closed entities and their proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Spending overview  \n",
    "   - Auto-detect columns containing “spend” or “amount”.  \n",
    "   - Compute average, median, min, and max to understand ranges and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Basic cleaning  \n",
    "   - Drop rows missing critical fields (e.g., posting_date, total_open_amount).  \n",
    "   - Fill missing categorical with “Unknown”.  \n",
    "   - Fill missing numeric with the median (more robust than mean for skewed data).  \n",
    "   - Recheck missing values after cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Grouping and aggregation  \n",
    "   - By business year: total open amount trend across years.  \n",
    "   - By customer: average invoice size per customer.  \n",
    "   - By currency: count, mean, and sum to understand currency exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of What You’ll Read From the Output\n",
    "- “We have N customers and M unique currencies; top categories look sensible.”  \n",
    "- “5% of rows miss posting_date; we’ll drop those to avoid timing distortions.”  \n",
    "- “Median transaction is far below the mean, suggesting a few very large invoices.”  \n",
    "- “Year-over-year totals show growth (or contraction); currency XYZ dominates exposure.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial/Business Interpretation\n",
    "- Data completeness drives reliability of KPIs (revenue, AR aging, margins).  \n",
    "- Distribution checks prevent a few extreme values from misleading averages.  \n",
    "- Grouped views (year, customer, currency) align with executive reporting and risk monitoring.  \n",
    "- Clear handling rules (drop vs fill) make analyses reproducible and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why do EDA first?\n",
    "- Quality control: catch problems before they contaminate metrics.  \n",
    "- Faster iteration: know which columns are usable and how.  \n",
    "- Credible insights: summaries reflect real business behavior, not data artifacts."
